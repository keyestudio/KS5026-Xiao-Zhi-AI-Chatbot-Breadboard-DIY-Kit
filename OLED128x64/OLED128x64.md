### Common Wiring Issues FAQ

1. **After flashing the firmware, the RGB light does not turn on**  
   - Please check whether the solder joints around the RGB light are properly soldered. If there are any unsoldered places, you can first use wires to connect the corresponding pads and check if the light functions normally after restarting.

2. **How to check for circuit faults?**  
   - **When not powered**: You can use a multimeter to measure continuity between wires and GND or 3.3V pins, checking for short or open circuits.  
   - **When powered**: Measure the voltage values between GND and other pins to see if they are within normal ranges (e.g., 5V, 3.3V); if abnormal, further check the corresponding module and connections.

3. **Why should the four-pin button be staggered in the breadboard?**  
   - Among the four-pin buttons, the two same-direction pins are interconnected; if inserted in the same row on the breadboard, it will cause a short circuit, making the button unable to work properly. It is essential to split the four pins into two rows to ensure the circuit closes only when pressed.

4. **Can I²C (SDA/SCL) and I²S (BCLK/LRCLK/DIN, etc.) pins be shared?**  
   - It is not recommended. The hardware signal formats, timing, and protocols of I²C and I²S are incompatible, requiring the use of separate corresponding GPIO pins for each.

5. **Why do the volume control buttons have no effect or always seem to be muted?**  
   - Please ensure that they are connected to the correct GPIO (e.g., 39 and 40) and that the "volume up / volume down" button pins are not reversed. If the hardware is correct, double-check the firmware version and sample code configuration for compatibility.

6. **What to do when contact problems frequently occur when using the breadboard?**  
   - This may be due to aging breadboard sockets or oxidation of component pins. You can try replacing with a new breadboard, cleaning the component pins, or using shorter jumper wires to reduce points of failure.

7. **How to connect the grounds of sensors, power modules, etc.?**  
   - The ground of external modules should be connected to the GND of the main control board, ensuring they all share the same ground line to avoid noise or signal stability issues.

> **Tip**: If you encounter problems that are difficult to locate, check if the power supply is stable (e.g., 5V or 3.3V) and ensure that the firmware version and sample code correspond to the actual wiring.

### 3. Flashing Firmware / Downloading to the Development Board

After extracting and entering the `flash_download_tool_3.9.7` directory, double-click to run `flash_download_tool_3.9.7.exe`. The interface appears as follows:

#### 1) Download Settings

1. **Chip Type (ChipType)**: Select `ESP32-S3`  
2. **Working Mode (WorkMode)**: Select `Develop`  
3. **Loading Mode (Download Mode)**: It is recommended to choose `UART` (if choosing USB, additional settings are required; not covered here).

![](media/38b46d212825491291a35bb8bc011d83.jpeg)

**Connecting and sRGB Explanation**:  
- When the development board's Type-C interface is facing you, the right port is the **UART** port, and the left port is the **USB** port; please do not confuse them.  
- If the onboard sRGB light has not been soldered, there may be warning prompts during tool identification (this does not affect flashing), and this can later be resolved by shorting the solder pads (see section 2 at the end of the document).

### How to Configure Device Wi-Fi

#### 1. Wi-Fi Network Configuration

##### 1) Start the Device
- After flashing the firmware, keep the device powered on, and press the **RST** button (shown in the diagram below) to restart the device, which will enter configuration mode.  
![Img](media/img-20250409155600.png)

#### 2) Configuration Status
- **sRGB Color Light Blinking Blue**: Indicates that the device is in configuration mode.  
- **sRGB Color Light Not On**: Refer to the second section of this page for details.  
- If the device is not in configuration mode or needs reconfiguration, press and hold the **configuration button (connects to GPIO 1)**, then press the **RST** button to reset; release RST first, then release the configuration button to re-enter configuration mode.  
- For firmware version ≥0.2.2, if three attempts to connect to the original Wi-Fi fail, the device will automatically return to configuration mode (you can press RST to restart the device when switching networks).

#### 3) Configuration Steps
1. **Connect to "Xiao Zhi" Wi-Fi**  
   Use your phone or computer to connect to the Wi-Fi emitted by the device (the name usually resembles *Xiaozhi-XXXXXX*).

![Img](media/img-20250419111300.png)

2. **Configure Network**  
   Click on the found Wi-Fi name *Xiaozhi-XXXXXX* to connect, which will automatically redirect to the configuration page:
  
![Img](media/img-20250419112718.png)

   > - Select 2.4G Wi-Fi (if using an iPhone hotspot, you need to enable “maximum compatibility”).  
   > - Enter the password, and click **Connect**.  
   > - If connected successfully, the interface will display “Done” and automatically restart after 3 seconds.

If there is no automatic redirection to the configuration page, you can also manually enter `http://192.168.4.1` in the browser's address bar to access the configuration page.

### 2. About the RGB Color Light on the Device

1. **Connection and Update Status**  
   - After power on, if the blue light blinks once, the device is connecting to Wi-Fi; if subsequently the **green light blinks**, it indicates successful connection and the device can be awakened by voice.  
   - If the blue light stays on: the device is performing OTA firmware updates, usually completing in under a minute.  
   - If the blue light keeps blinking: the device is in configuration mode.  
   - During voice awakening, if the blue light turns on, it indicates that it is connecting to the server.  
   - A green light indicates that the device is playing audio.  
   - A red light indicates that the device is recording audio.

2. **RGB Light Not Turning On**  
   - If the light switch has not been soldered, it will not affect Wi-Fi configuration but will prevent you from checking the device status.
